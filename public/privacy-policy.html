            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy
                policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you
                may provide (“Personal Information”) on the <strong>instagram.gozar.team</strong> website (“Website” or
                “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices
                for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also
                describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can
                access and update it.</p>

            <p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and
                <strong>GozarShop</strong> (“GozarShop”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement
                on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such
                entity to this agreement. If you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you may not access or
                use the Website and Services.</p>

            <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without revealing your identity. However, to use certain
                features, we may request Personal Information such as your name and email address.</p>
            <p>We also collect information from third-party sources, including public databases, social media platforms,
                and data providers. This may include demographic, device, location, and behavioral data.</p>

            <h2>Privacy of Children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from individuals under 18. Parents should monitor their
                children's internet usage and help enforce this Policy.</p>

            <h2>Use and Processing of Information</h2>
            <p>We act as both data controller and data processor, depending on the context. We use Personal Information
                to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
                <li>Operate and maintain the Website and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Processing may rely on your consent, contract performance, legal obligations, or our legitimate
                interests.</p>

            <h2>Managing Information</h2>
            <p>You may update or delete certain Personal Information. Deleted data may be retained for legal or
                operational reasons.</p>

            <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
            <p>We may share your data with service providers under strict confidentiality and purpose-limited
                conditions. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>

            <h2>Retention of Information</h2>
            <p>We retain Personal Information only as long as necessary to fulfill legal, operational, or contractual
                obligations.</p>

            <h2>Data Analytics</h2>
            <p>We may use third-party analytics tools for usage statistics. These tools do not collect personally
                identifiable information.</p>

            <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>Our Website currently does not respond to Do Not Track signals due to lack of standardization across
                browsers.</p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>We may use third-party advertising partners to display targeted ads. These partners may use cookies and
                tracking technologies.</p>

            <h2>Links to Other Resources</h2>
            <p>Our Website may link to external resources. We are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please
                review their privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Information Security</h2>
            <p>We use technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information. However,
                no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

            <h2>Data Breach</h2>
            <p>In case of a data breach, we will notify affected users and authorities as required by law. We may also
                post a notice on the Website.</p>

            <h2>Changes and Amendments</h2>
            <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Website and Services implies acceptance
                of any updates.</p>

                Website and Services.</p>
